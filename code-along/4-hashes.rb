# To run this code, be sure your current working directory
# is the same as where this file is located and then run:
# ruby 4-hashes.rb

# Hashes are lists of *key-value pairs*
# profile = {"name" => "Ben", "location"=> "Chicago", "Status" => "Studying"}
# puts profile
# puts profile.inspect
# Accessing data from the hash
puts profile["name"]
puts " Hi, #{profile['name']} "
